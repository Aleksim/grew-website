To detect your website or webapp users' location, you have options to either use browser's Geolocation API or the client's IP-address. Whether your goal is to eg. personalize content, target advertisement, or create redirects, you need to send your users' latitude and longitude data, or IP-address to a third-party geocoding service. These services extract the readable place names from the data and return it to your client.

<p>
  The process is straightforward, but it comes with privacy drawbacks.
</p>

## Hyper-secure location detection with pointNG

To save time and avoid privacy-headaches, follow these steps to identify your user's GPS-based location without sending their coordinates away from the browser.

<p>
1. Install pointNG location detection javascript plugin on each page on your website you wish to use your users' location:
</p>

```js
<script src="https://cdn.pointng.io/pointng-min.js"></script>
```

<p>
 2. Paste this code below to initialize and configure pointNG:
</p>

```js
const pointng = new PointNG({
 level: 'city',
 api_key: 'YOUR-API-KEY-HERE'
});
```

Use the 'level' parameter to choose the level you wish to identify your users'
location. Options are 'continent', 'country', 'state' and 'city'. If a user
declines your website to use her GPS-location, pointNG uses the device time
zone as the default fallback to estimate the location.
<p>
    3. Sign up <a href="https://app.pointng.io/register?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=get_user_location_securely_in_javascript_without_privacy_hassle" target="_blank">here</a> to whitelist your domain, and grab your free API-key.
    Paste the key to the initialization script's 'api_key' parameter.
</p>

## Do your magic!

That's it! Now you are ready to start building location-based web services securely without the fear of data misuses and privacy headaches.
Below is an example of a basic implementation that prompts the user for location permission and logs the user's location.

```js
<script src="https://cdn.pointng.io/pointng.js"></script>
<script>
const pointng = new PointNG({ 
  level: "city",
  api_key: "YOUR-API-KEY-HERE"
})
pointng.getLocation().then(function (prediction) { 
  console.log(prediction)
  //Do your magic here
})
</script>
```
